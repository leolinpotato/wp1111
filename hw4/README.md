# Web Programming HW#4
## Basic Requirements
### Initial Layout
There is a "startGame" state in MineSweeper.js which decides to display HomePage or Board. If "startGame" == false, HomePage will be displayed. Otherwise, Board will be displayed.
### Start Button
Once the start button be clicked, the "startGame" will be set to true.
### FreshBoard
Create a newBoard using "createBoard" function, and set the board, mineLocations, nonMineCount, remainFlagNum accordingly.
### Construct the Board using "map"
Using nested map calling \<Cell> function to construct a 2-D map.
### Update Flag
Once the cell is clicked by right click, the "updateFlag" function in Board.js will be called.
1. If the cell has been revealed, nothing will happen and the function will return. 
2. If the cell hasn't be revealed and it hasn't be flagged either, its flagged state will be set to true and the remainFlagNum will decrease by one.
3. If the cell hasn't be revealed but it has be flagged, its flagged state will be set to false and the remainFlagNum will increase by one.
### Reveal Cell
Once the cell is clicked by left click, the "revealCell" function in Board.js will be called.
1. If the cell.value === 'ðŸ’£', "gameOver" state will be set to true.
2. Otherwise, it will call "revealed" function to update the board. If "nonMineCount" = 0, it will set "gameOver" and "win" to true.
## Advanced Requirements
### Difficulty Adjustment
A "Difficulty Adjustment" button is displayed on HomePage. Once it is clicked, \<div className="controlWrapper">\<div> will be shown. Player can modify Mines Number and Board Size. If Mines Number more than the number of cells(nxn), an error message will pop out, and the color of controlNum will change as well. In the meantime, the Start Button can't be pressed.
### Advanced reveal function
If the value of the revealed cell = 0, all of the neighboring cells which are not mines will be revealed as well. This function will work recursively.
### Modal
1. When all of the nonMine cells are revealed, the modal will appear with title "WIN".
2. Whenever a mine is revealed, the modal will appear with title "Game Over".
### Timer
Game starts at time = 0. When the game is over, the time on the timer will display the time game ended.
